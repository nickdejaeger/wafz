We Are From Zemst

A responsive website project to bring the people of Zemst together by sharing pictures all over the world representing the town emblem.

# TODO

- Create a wall of images
- Hover over an image to see details
- Alternative hover for mobile users
- Create a Map view with custom markers
- Redesign the upload form with the modal view expirience

# Notes

- We will work with one page because we only have 2 sections (wall and map). These 2 sections will be seperated with a tab view.
